**What is AI- Artificial Intelligence ?**
	- AI as an academic discipline was founded in 50s.
	- Actually AI was coined by John - McCarthy, an American computer scientist back in 1956 at The Dartmouth Conference.
	- According to him- The science and engineering of making intelligent machines,especially intelligent computer programs.

**What is AI ML and DEEP neural network ?**
	- AI - Engineering of making intelligent Machines and Programs.
	- Ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
	- Learning based on Deep neural network.
	- ML is science of getting computers act without being explicitly programmed.
	- 1950s - AI - Any technique which enables computers to mimic human behavior.
	- ML - Technique that gives the computers ability to learn without being explicitly programmed to do so.
	- Deep Learning - A subset of ML which makes the computation of multilayer neural networks feasible.
	- So DL is a new thing and beauty is that they can learn/extract/translate the features from data sets such as images, videos or texts without introducing traditional hand coded rules.


**There are different models that generally fall into 3 different categories ?**
	- Supervised Learning.
	- Unsupervised Learning.
	- Reinforcement Learning.



**Supervised Learning ?**
	- Supervised learning as the name indicates the presence of a supervisor as a teacher. Basically supervised learning is a learning in which we teach or train the machine using data which is well labeled that means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. After that, the machine is provided with a new set of examples(data) so that supervised learning algorithm analyses the training data(set of training examples) and produces a correct outcome from labeled data. 


    - Classification: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “Red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.
    - Regression: A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.



**Unsupervised Learning ?**
	- Unsupervised learning is the training of machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance.
	- Here the task of the machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities,patterns and differences without any prior training of data.
	- Unlike supervised learning no teacher is provided that means no training will be given to the machine.Therefore machine is restricted to find the hidden structure in unlabeled data by our-self.
	- Categorization of dogs and cats on similarities machine identifies.
	- We did not learn here anything before so meaning no training data or examples.

	- We have clustering and association 2 categories of algorithm.

    - Clustering: A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior.
    - Association: An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y.

**What is Reinforcement Learning ?**
	- Systems are trained be receiving virtual rewards or punishments essentially learning by trial and error.

**What is Deep Learning ?**
	- Deep Learning is also a method of statistical learning that extracts features or attribute from raw data sets.
	- The main point of difference is DL does this by utilizing multi-layer artificial neural networks.
	- There are three popular DL models.
		- Convolutional Neural Network.
		- Recurrent Neural Network.
		- Generative Adversarial Network.

	- All these come under ANN (Artificial neural network)



	- So basically a simple neural network has one layer, but a deep neural network has many layers, i.e deep in the network.

**What is CNN and Layers in CNN ?**
	- Input layer , conv + relu , conv + relu pooling, Flatten, fully connected and softmax.
	- Each layer works for itself.
	- Many times the filters are not enough to get the features out of the image.
	- Hence back propagation, adjustment of weights and many other things are involved.\
	- Hence more the data , more the proper training and more the network model properly trained.
	- E.g Alibaba organization which takes care of traffic system and other things.
	- Google photo search, Facebook - Automatic tagging, E - shopping etc.
	- So CNN is the most used network and many things are involved in the layer architecture as u can see in the above para.

**What is RNN ?**
	- The main thing is RNN can remember the formal input again , an then feed to the network.
	- Which makes it a distinct.
	- Mostly used in Speech recognition tasks and all.


**What is GNN ?**
	- GNN stands for generative network and discriminative network.
	- Generates random noise output taking random noise input.
	- Gradually with help of discriminator it starts generating images of particular class that looks real.
	- GANS can be used to create fake realistic images of real images.
	- Hence can be used to do many tasks and may things.


**What is NLP ?**
	- NLP stands for natural language processing.
	- Google assistant , siri etc.

**Frame works for Machine Learning ?**
	- Keras due to its user friendly.
	- Tensorflow --Google.
	- Pytorch -- Face book.
	- CNTK -- Microsoft.
	- Apaches MXnet -- Amazon.


- So yes there is a revolution coming , same like the one which introduced computers and electronic gadgets outside in the world.
- AI will take over and new things will come up.
- So lets choose a topic in machine learning and lets move towards it.
